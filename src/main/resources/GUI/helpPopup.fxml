Here is where all imported records and lists can be viewed and manipulated. &#10;&#10;1.1.1 IMPORTING &amp; EXPORTING DATA &#10;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;From the FILE menu in the top left of the window you can IMPORT or EXPORT .csv files and view them in the raw data viewer. Make sure the files have the right headers for the object type they represent! &#10;Once the data has been imported and added to a list it can be viewed in the DATA tab. &#10;In the DATA tab you can select the type of data you wish to view (retailers/routes/wifi) and then select a stored list of those objects.&#10;&#10;&#10;1.1.2 FAVOURITES &#10;++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;Select any record and click the 'add to favourites' button to add it to your custom favourites list. You can view these favourites with the 'Show Favourite only', where you can remove them if you wish. &#10;To return to the standard list click the 'Change to Default' button. Favourites are stored persistently between sessions just like the standard lists.&#10;&#10;&#10;1.1.3 FILTERING AND SEARCHING &#10;++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;The two boxes next to the FILTER button are used to filter data. The first identifies a header (Street / ZIP / Type etc) and the second displays all available entries in the current list for that header. &#10;Once both boxes have been selected, the FILTER button then displays all objects which match the criteria. &#10;&#10;To search, select a header from the first box next to SEARCH, then enter a custom term in the empty box next to it and click SEARCH, and any objects which contain that term will be displayed. &#10;To reset to the stand view click the 'Change to Default' button.&#10;&#10;&#10;1.1.4 ALTERING DATA &amp; ADDING AND DELETING ROUTES &#10;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;To alter any parts of a certain record, click the SHOW DETAILS button and all information for a highlighted entry will be displayed in a pop up window. This is all fully editable and can be saved with the APPLY button. &#10;If Routes are being viewed, in the bottom right they can be directly added and removed from a given list using the ADD ROUTE/DELETE ROUTE buttons. &#10;Remember when adding a route to include the right kind of information for each entry!&#10;&#10;&#10;1.1.5 CLOSING &#10;++++++++++++&#10;&#10;When the application is closed, all lists are saved and stored so that when the app is relaunched all data is still there. This data can be found in the same folder as the .jar file.&#10;&#10;&#10;---------------- 1.2 THE MAP PANEL  ----------------&#10;The map panel contains the map view, where routes and points of interests can be more easily visualised and be altered to show nearby wifi hotspots.&#10;&#10;&#10;1.2.1 THE MAP VIEW &#10;++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;When the MAP panel is clicked, occasionally the map will not load. This is a known bug and can be fixed by right clicking and selecting 'Reload page'. &#10;In the map view all Retailers and Wifi locations can be toggled for viewing, and highlighted routes and locations can have the closest wifi location/s shown.&#10;&#10;&#10;1.2.2 FINDING ROUTES &#10;+++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;Using the two search boxes in the top left, an address or set of co-ordinates can be entered in and Google's mapping algorithms will find a cycle route between the two after a brief delay. &#10;If nothing changes then no route can be found, so ensure that the locations are spelt correctly.&#10;&#10;---------------- 1.3 THE STAT PANEL ---------------- &#10;The statistics panel shows further details about a route. Select a highlighted route and click the &quot;Show Stats&quot; button to be redirected to the statistics panel. &#10;The shown information will be about the highlighted route, based on the cyclists weight and average speed. These values can be changed manually and the statistics will change accordingly once the RECALCULATE STATISTICS button is pressed.&#10;"
